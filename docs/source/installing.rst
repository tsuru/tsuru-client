Installing
==========

There are several ways to install `tsuru-client`:

- `Downloading binaries (Mac OS X and Linux)`_
- `Using homebrew (Mac OS X only)`_
- `Using the PPA (Ubuntu only)`_
- `Using AUR (ArchLinux only)`_
- `Build from source (Linux and Mac OS X)`_

Downloading binaries (Mac OS X and Linux)
-----------------------------------------

We provide pre-built binaries for OS X and Linux, only for the amd64
architecture. You can download these binaries directly from the releases page
of the project:

    * tsuru: https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru-client/releases

Using homebrew (Mac OS X only)
------------------------------

If you use Mac OS X and `homebrew <https://brew.sh/>`_, you may
use a custom tap to install ``tsuru``. First you need to add the tap:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ brew tap tsuru/homebrew-tsuru

Now you can install tsuru:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ brew install tsuru

Whenever a new version of any of tsuru's clients is out, you can just run:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ brew update
    $ brew upgrade tsuru

For more details on taps, check `homebrew documentation
<https://docs.brew.sh/Taps>`_.

**NOTE:** tsuru requires Go 1.2 or higher. Make sure you have the last version
of Go installed in your system.

Using the PPA (Ubuntu only)
---------------------------

Ubuntu users can install tsuru clients using ``apt-get`` and the `tsuru PPA
<https://launchpad.net/~tsuru/+archive/ppa>`_. You'll need to add the PPA
repository locally and run an ``apt-get update``:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:tsuru/ppa
    $ sudo apt-get update

Now you can install tsuru's clients:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ sudo apt-get install tsuru-client

Using AUR (ArchLinux only)
--------------------------

Archlinux users can build and install tsuru client from AUR repository,
Is needed to have installed `yaourt <http://archlinux.fr/yaourt-en>`_ program.

You can run:


.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ yaourt -S tsuru

Build from source (Linux and Mac OS X)

    If you're feeling adventurous, you can try it on other systems, like
    FreeBSD, OpenBSD or even Windows. Please let us know about your progress!

`tsuru client source <https://github.com/tsuru/tsuru-client>`_ is written in `Go
